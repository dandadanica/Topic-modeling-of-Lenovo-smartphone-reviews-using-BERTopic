1811,received it today the first thing I noticed that there was no earphone in the box second thing phone is heating too much in normal use and while charging it heats up more also the screen seems to be having some problem as the colors are not clear on screen I see some blue shades on screen on every picture app and other screens 
1812,super
1813,pros good battery stock androidvery smoothcons bad dual camera probably a fix with software update sometimes overheats
1814,pros good operating speed sufficient battery life and speakers satisfying display quality front cameras good cons RR camera is not up to the expectation cannot feel the impact of dual cameras and picture quality is very poor not smart enough very limited customization options lack of some basic apps gallery music players etc. 
1815,nice product with best packaging
1816,"not so good many main features are missing like call recording and not third party app support blur effect in camera not so good auto screen sleep when flip cover used not satisfied with front flesh light, take much time with other charger like USB power bank expect charger with that screen too good multiple windows a good feature in that one speakers only lower side strep and Dolby average overall average and upgrade model leg from previous numbers like k note honor I is batter one"
1817,"the delivery was good which as usual from amazon, but the phone screen glass is very fragile it is not the break resistant I had my phone a small fall from about ft and the glass broke to replace I have to shell out about k I haven't expected this from the so called gorilla glass it is not gorilla glass gene and hence be careful it is not meant for even little rough use "
1819,Received just now I'm fully satisfied with this mobile thanks to amazon for your great delivery 
1820,after a few days left side speaker stopped working all of a sudden I didn't think I will be delivered such defective products from amazon really disappointed 
1821,Bluetooth audio has an intermittent noise battery of me only is good for numbers not in terms of long lasting device operation poor power management to blame my earlier mis max with me gives days battery this one if it was equally good in power management should give at least days but barely lasts a day don't buy this

1832,charging cable is of poor quality within months of purchase it was not charging service center in Bangalore did not give a free replacement during the warranty period on flimsy grounds of liquid damage all contacts in the cable should be water moisture proof for robust quality think twice before buying

3825, serious heating issues on the back side headphone slot is narrow u have a push headphone jack very hard by doing so you might break your jack not latching to the mobile network easily likewise just a regular slab phone its heavy not expected from a brand like Lenovo it's not a killer phone Lenovo you just killed the Lenovo k note branding 
3826,"all hype, no performance truly disappointed by this phone terrible camera heavy battery issue hangs even though its stock android with go ram "

3837,pros comes with a factory fitted silicon case ok interface for stock android good looking phone Dolby Atmos is a good inclusioncons battery on single SIM lasts hrs for a power user a dual SIM would further reduce longevity the much vaulted camera has a delayed shutter action I used this phone after using a redmi s the k pales in comparison in terms of key user parameters 
3838,Please don't buy this phone if you are accepting that this phone battery will long last till a day that's not possible because this phone battery drains very fast in spite of being a mAh battery ultimately this phone is worthless I had wasted my money plz u don't dare to do the same this phone has heating problem too am crying for my money know this is a dumb phone

3991,It's okay 
3992,overall the phone is good but there is a issue with the built on Jio as if the phone is kept idle for mins then you'll keep on missing calls as the other party ll get that your Sim is either switched off or not reachable this is a big flaw if the phone is that enabled as one can't continuously keep on using the phone just to receive a call a software update is required in this regards

4301,"never buy this product signal quality is poor cast option does not work Bluetooth connectivity is poor sound breaks in between does not have option to edit pictures, video streaming is poor or takes times to start video there dialing page is not user friendly frequent dialed number are displayed in large size, hence leading to unnecessary calling on frequent dialed camera quality is very poor and pixels break on initial zoom only moreover flash light nothing worst then that overall a bad choice in same price you can find much better device meeting your expectations "

4303,"this is one of the worst mobile phones I have ever used in my life, it is getting so hot while talking "
4304,best mobile but battery not good
4305,I fell for the spectacular specs of k note when it was launched it died out on me just after finishing the warranty period horrible support team and ridiculously expensive repair so I ditched it loosing some data also along with it and then I did it again I fell for fake glitters when the k note was launched despite all the friendly warnings hardly a month in its already starting to taste bitter casting design t work restarts all too often at its own will a dual camera that is a joke many apps hangs often despite the jaw dropping specs deca core my foot verdict Lenovo is not dependable
4306,very good deal value for money working smoothly even in GB ram only reason for not giving star because it is not coming with earphone
4307,not supported to vote camera is not good and voice call clarity low 
4308,Pro's best design d curved glass like nokia cameras are excellent except in dual modeno lagmain thing is the Dolby atmosbest surround effect and if you are a music lover then go for icons bad battery backup it is meant overheating but while charging get heated up

4326,fantastic phone in every aspect gets charged very quickly amazing sound quality for high quality movies it has Dolby Atmos sound if you enable Dolby and watch movies with Dolby sound you will get a real theatrical effect on this little phone with headphones on real value for money I am really surprised by the sound quality 
4327,"It's an excellent piece of art based on performance and battery, but w turbocharger is not the right name for its charger because it takes around mins to nearly hours sometimes to charge the mobile"
4328,"after updating heating, phone"

11310,revising my earlier review written about months ago in which I gave stars the biggest problem is battery which is getting worse with each system update its mAh battery is worse than a contemporary similar phone with me battery something seriously wrong and the irony is no serious effort by Lenovo to rectify it barely after months of the purchase I have to recharge the phone twice every day it now seems the problem is beyond redemption secondly I am not able to send the image from photos to a folder on selecting the image without being online

12693,as shown in ad it's not a killer camera are not up to the mark only two things are great one is touch pad and finger sensor all major applications are belonging to google only Lenovo doesn't own any app not any music player themes wallpaper not even set our own ringtone

12766,I am not totally satisfied 
12767,just average
12768,awesome phone battery backup is a very nice camera is also good and the sound system is better because of Dolby Atmos
